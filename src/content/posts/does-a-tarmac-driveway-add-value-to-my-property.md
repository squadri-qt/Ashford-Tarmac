**Are you considering revamping your driveway and wondering if tarmac is the right choice? You're not alone. Many homeowners in the UK face this dilemma, and a key concern is whether a tarmac driveway will add value to their property.**

### Tarmac increases value

The answer is yes, a tarmac driveway can potentially increase your property value. Studies show that well-maintained tarmac driveways can add between 5% and 10% to your home's value [source: Property Price Advice](https://www.propertypriceadvice.co.uk/home-improvements/much-value-driveway-add-home). This translates to a significant increase in your home's overall market value.

### Driveways added benefits
Beyond the potential increase in value, tarmac driveways offer several advantages that make them desirable to potential buyers:

### Enhanced Curb Appeal 
A sleek, modern tarmac driveway creates a positive first impression for potential buyers. It conveys a sense of care and attention to detail, making your property stand out from the competition.

### Increased Functionality
Tarmac provides a smooth, level surface that's ideal for parking cars and maneuvering vehicles. This is particularly important for families with multiple cars or those who value convenience.

### Low Maintenance
Compared to other driveway materials like gravel or grass, tarmac requires minimal upkeep. Occasional cleaning and periodic resealing (every 3-5 years) are the main maintenance needs, saving homeowners time and money in the long run.

### Durability
Tarmac is a highly durable material that can withstand harsh weather conditions and heavy use for many years. Its average lifespan is 10-20 years with proper maintenance, making it a worthwhile investment.

### The drive of your dreams
If you're considering adding value to your property and improving its functionality, a tarmac driveway is an excellent choice.

Remember, a well-installed and maintained tarmac driveway can significantly enhance your property's value and appeal to potential buyers.
