**The driveway area is expected to last for years since it is supposed to be tough, but it is not immune to damage over time.**

If you want to avoid having to pay for major repairs after a few years, consider some ways to keep it in good shape.

The first step to avoid major driveway repair is to keep cracks small once they appear. You can typically do this by buying sealant from any home improvement store. This is usually inexpensive, and you can apply it to cracks easily, especially if you have a caulking gun for this purpose. If not, you can just pour it into the crack so that the area is filled in. This should get rid of it, or at least stop it from getting bigger. If you are not sure of the best product to use, or how to apply it, you should ask employees at the home improvement store since they may be able to advise you.

### Large crack in tarmac
If the cracks in the concrete are already large, and have even turned into minor holes, you may have to get a stronger product, not just simple sealant. You should fill any holes with a product made with asphalt patch, which can be recommended to you by your local home improvement store staff member if you are not sure which one to buy. Particularly large holes may need to be filled in with heavy-duty products, such as coarse aggregate space filler. Just note that if you do not take care of this issue soon, any time the area freezes and then thaws, the issue will get bigger until it requires you get professional driveway repair instead of solving the problem on your own. Fixing the issue fast is worth your time, so do not be tempted to put it off.

### Filled tarmac
Once you have filled in any holes or cracks in the area, it is time to seal it so it stays nice for several more years. You can do this by buying either a sealer with a base of either acrylic or coal tar. The choice is yours, though you can also find out the pros and cons from the store you buy the product from. You will likely need a large amount of this product to seal the entire surface, and you will need special tools to do it, such as a large applicator to brush it on. If you do not wish to buy these items, or simply do not have the time or knowledge to do the job yourself, consider hiring a driveway repair professional.

### Help with tarmac
Not everyone can do this job on their own, but just ignoring the issue altogether can result in your home needing major repairs down the road. If you are not willing to make a few trips to the hardware store for the products and tools you need, you should locate a good company that can take a look at the surface in front of your house to determine how to fix it.
