Our client, The National Trust. had recently purchased some land that would provide more suitable access to their lighthouse in Dover. There was an existing unmade track leading up to the lighthouse but in its present state was unsuitable for the use of vehicles. Due to the varied wildlife habitating in the area, consideration was given to their breeding and nesting times and works was scheduled around these periods. The existing roadway leading to the lighthouse was an unmade track consisting of stone and sub base material. The track had become very overgrown in places and along the entire length of the road there were many potholes. 

A 360-degree Excavator was used to grade and level the existing surface. Extreme care was taken to ensure none of the excavated soil spilled onto the surrounding grass land, this land is a designated ‘Site of Special Scientific Interest” (SSSI) by Natural England. Once the existing surface had been prepared a new Tarmacadam surface was machine laid, this was laid in one layer which consisted of 14mm nominal size Close Graded Surface Course Material to a depth of 70mm. The whole project was completed in four days.
