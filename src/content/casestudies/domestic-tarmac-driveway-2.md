As well as carrying out Tarmac surfacing to both the Public and Commercial Sector we provide the same service to the Domestic & Residential Sector. This particular project was to carry out resurfacing work to an existing tarmac driveway.

This residential project includes the tarmacadam resurfacing to an existing driveway and footpath. New concrete edging curbs replaced existing brick edging curbs that had deteriorated over the years. The existing surface was cleaned and a bitumen emulsion tack coat sprayed over the area. A new surface was then laid which consisted of a 30mm thick layer of stone mastic asphalt surface course material. The new surface will not require renewing for at least 20 to 25 years.
