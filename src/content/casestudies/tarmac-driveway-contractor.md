For 5 years we have been the designated contractors for the Bruderhof Community at their sites in Nonnington near Canterbury and Robertsbridge in East Sussex. The most recent project we completed involved the resurfacing of their existing roads. The roads had not been surfaced for over 30 years and therefore required extensive preparation. 

This included mechanically sweeping all areas and regulating with a Tarmac Binder Course Material to provide a substantial base for the laying of the new wearing course. New wearing course was 30mm depth of Stone Mastic Asphalt Surface Course Material. This project was completed in four days.
