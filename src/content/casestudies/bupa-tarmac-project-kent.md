The works for this project involved the replacement of existing concrete slab footpaths. The paving slabs had become very slippery and uneven, an extreme hazard especially for elderly people. We removed all the existing paving slabs and disposed of them to tip. New Tanalised Timber Edging was installed to all sides of the footpath areas. All existing manhole covers which required adjusting were raised to suit the new levels. 

In some areas we extended the existing footpath widths to enable easier access for wheelchairs. This was done by excavating the existing soil to a depth of 100mm and laying Type One Sub Base Material. All areas were ready to receive the overall new surface â€“ 60mm depth of 10mm nominal size Open Textured Surface Course Macadam. In this instance an Open Textured Asphalt was required to ensure adequate drainage to the footpaths, avoiding any ponding of surface water which during the winter months would subsequently freeze creating a hazard to all residents.
