For 30 years we have undertaken numerous projects for The University of Kent at both the Canterbury and Medway campus. This project was to resurface an existing car park at the Canterbury campus.

The resurfacing of one of the main car parks involved the preparation of the existing tarmac surface and regulating low and pothole areas. The material used for the top layer was 10mm nominal size Stone Mastic Asphalt. On completion new road markings were applied to form the parking bays.

We are able to offer a flexible and professional service to the education sector and have carried out many school projects throughout Kent and Sussex.
