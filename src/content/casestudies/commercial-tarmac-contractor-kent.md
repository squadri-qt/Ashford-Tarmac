We have been a surfacing contractor at Leeds castle in Kent for the last 10 years. This project was to resurface the causeway which runs alongside the moat. This project involved the removal of the existing tarmacadam surface and then re-laying with a new surfacing material.

To avoid disruption to the daily running of the castle and itâ€™s visitors, we carried out the work over two consecutive evenings. The work had been planned for 3 evenings but we finished ahead of schedule, completing in just 2 evenings. The removal of the existing tarmac surface was carried out using a road planing machine on the first evening. That area was then made safe for public use for the next day. The second evening involved the laying of a new tarmac surface with a tarmac paving machine. Surfacing material used on the contract was 6mm nominal size stone mastic asphalt, which is suitable for both vehicle and pedestrian use.
