This project was to replace an existing gravel driveway at a residential property. After having a gravel driveway for many years the client had decided that they required a more practical surface. They favoured the lighter more natural appearance of gravel but were tired of finding loose stones in their house and cars!

The residential driveway lead to a property situated on the Kent & Sussex border. The existing loose surface was removed and the existing sub base prepared. New charcoal Block Edging Kerbs were installed together with a “double band” of Block Paviors to the perimeter of the driveway. A new Open Textured Surface Course was laid to 70mm depth and the final surface layer was 18mm depth of Resin Bound Aggregate. The clients choice of colour was “natural gravel” with a charcoal coloured band laid to the edge of the granite setts to enhance the overall effect.
