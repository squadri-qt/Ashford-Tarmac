This project involved the excavation and removal of an existing concrete driveway and replaced with new tarmac surface. Once the old driveway had been removed, a layer of type one sub base material was compacted to form the foundation to the driveway. 

Concrete Black Paviors were set to provide a decorative edge and wooden sleepers laid to form a retaining wall between the garden and driveway. The tarmac surface consisted of a 50mm depth of Binder Course and 30mm depth of Surface Course. The project took just 4 days to complete.
